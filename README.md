# UFOs
Javascript analysis for coding bootcamp

# Analysis Overview

This project was focused around being able to take data stored as a Javscript array, and being able to use that data to build out a webpage with a table that can be filtered based on user's input. 
The data for this project was a list of UFO exposures, and the data included exposure date, city, country, and ufo shape. 

# Results

The webpage created for this project **[UFO Sightings] (http://tbrech4.github.io/UFOs/)** allows users to filter the list of UFO exposures based on a number of criteria.
